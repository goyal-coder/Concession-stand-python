Overview
This Python script simulates a Concession Stand where users can:
✅ View a menu of available items with prices.
✅ Select items to add to their cart.
✅ See the updated cart and total cost after each selection.
✅ Get a final order summary upon checkout.

How It Works
A dictionary (menu) stores food items with their prices.
A loop allows users to enter items by name to add them to the cart.
The program checks if the item exists:
✅ If found, it's added to the cart, and the total is updated.
❌ If not found, an error message appears.
When the user enters "q", the program exits and displays a final receipt showing:
Items purchased.
Quantity of each item.
Grand total.
The program ensures proper formatting and error handling.
Features
🔹 Displays menu in a readable format.
🔹 Handles duplicate items in the cart.
🔹 Prevents invalid inputs.
🔹 Neatly formatted final order summary.

This script is a great example of dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Python! 🚀
